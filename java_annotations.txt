what are java annotations:
special labels/markers added to java classes:
provide meta data about the class:
processed at compile time or run-time for special processing.

Why spring configuration with annotation:
xml onfiguration can be  verbose:
configuere ur spring bean with annotation:
annotations minimise the XML configuration:

Scanning for component classs:
spring will scan ur java classes for special annotation:
automatically register the beans in the spring container:

development process:
enable component scanning from spring config file:
add the @Component Annotation to ur java class:
retrive the bean from spring container


Spring also supports Default Bean IDs
Default bean id:the class name, make first letter lower case:
Class name :TennisCoach
default bean id: tennisCoach
