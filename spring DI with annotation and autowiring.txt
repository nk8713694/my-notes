Demo Example:
Our Coach already provides dail workouts:
now will also provide daily fortunes:

new helper: FortuneService
this is a dependency

what is Spring auto-wiring?
for dependency injection ,Spring can use auto wiring

Spring will look for a class that matches the property 
matches by type:class or interface:

Spring will inject it automatically .... hence it is auto-wired

Auto-wiring example:
injecting FortuneService into Coach implementation
spring will scan @Components
Any one implements FortuneService interface??
if so let's inject them.for example :HappyFortuneService

autowiring injection types:
Constructor injection:
Setter injection:
Field injections:


development process for constructor injection:
1.define the dependency intreface and class:
2.create a constructor in your class for injections;
3.configure the dependency injection with @Autowired annotation

setter injection
easy:

which injection should we use:
choose a style(injection) and be consistent in that project

Autowiring :
injecting FortuneService into a Coach implementation
spring will scan @Components
Anyone implements the FortuneService interface??
if yes the inject them ..... oops whcih one?
ex: happfortune or sadfortune or databasefortuneservice
 u will get an complitaion error
injecting autowired dependencies failed nouniquebeandefination

Injection types:
Can apply @Qualifier annotation to:
constructor ,setter and field injection
@Qualifier("happyFortuneService")
