the need for validations:
check the user input form the user:
required fields:
valid number sin range:
custom business rule:
vlalid format(postal code)

Java bean validation api:
java has a standard bean validation API
defininga meat mode and API for entity validation
spsring validation 
spring version 4 and higher suppprts bean validation API
prefered method for validation when building the spring apps:
simply add validation jars to our project
annotation validdation @NotNull 
@Min
@Max
@Size
@Pattern 
@Future/@Past
others:........

our road map:
1.set up deveelopment envirmonment:
reuired field
validate number  range: min /max
validate using reular expresision(reqexp)
custom validation

Java's Standard Bean Validation API
Java standard bean validation api(JSR-303/309)
Only a specifiaction vendor independent ... portable
but still we need an implementation

The Hibernate team comes to rescue:
Hibernate started a ORM   project:
but in recent years,they have expandeed into others areas;
they have fully complaint JSR(303/309) impelmentation
Not tied to ORM sor database work.....seperate project


development process:
download the validation jar files from hibernate website:
add jar file to the project


whitspace :

our previos example has aproblem with a white space:
last name field with all whitespace passed yikes:
should have failed:

@InitBinder
@InitBinder annotation will work as a prepocessor
it will pre-process each web request to oufr controller:
method annotated with @InitBinder is executed

wew will us eto trim left and right whitespace
if string has only whitepsace then trim to null:
